Features implemented in this order:

-class structure / variables, 'struct tm' for time
-input loop, output loop

#include <iostream>

#include "completeActivity.hpp"
#include "fillActivityVector.hpp"
#include "activitySplitter.hpp"

int main() {

    // make the 'master vector'
    std::vector<completeActivity> allActivities;

    fillActivityVector(allActivities);

	// put the walks into our map
	auto activity_map = activitySplitter::doSplit(allActivities);

	// print results
	activitySplitter::dump(activity_map);

}
