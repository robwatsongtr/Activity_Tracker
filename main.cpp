ActivityTracker

Created by Robert Watson 2019-2020
Copyright © 2019 Robert Watson. All rights reserved.
Additional help by Robert Diamond.

Features implemented in this order:

-class structure / variables, 'struct tm' for time
-input loop, output loop
-error handling / input parsing
-stable sorting by time and name. This will be supplanted by below:

TODO:
Some text here.
Needs Data Structure Kung Fu: Move objects into std::list, then std::lists(s)
into std::map
So as to sort and compute fastest, slowest, average of each activity easily
